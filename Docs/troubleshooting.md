# Troubleshooting

## `mcpbridge` cannot be executed
`xcode-mcp-proxy-server` spawns `xcrun mcpbridge` as an upstream process.
If it fails:

- Confirm Xcode is installed and selected (`xcode-select -p`).
- Confirm `xcrun mcpbridge -h` works in Terminal.

## `MCP client ... timed out`
Ensure the proxy server is running. Increase `startup_timeout_sec` in the client config if needed.

If you see an error like:

- `timed out awaiting tools/list after 10s`

it’s usually because the upstream (`xcrun mcpbridge` / Xcode) was slow on the first `tools/list`.

- `xcode-mcp-proxy-server` prewarms and caches `tools/list` **in memory** once it’s ready, and serves it immediately on subsequent requests.
- The tool list cache is **not persisted to disk**. It survives repeated Codex restarts as long as the proxy server stays running.
- `tools/list` is intentionally treated as stable for the lifetime of the proxy process (no background refresh), to avoid upstream churn and surprise Xcode permission dialogs.

## HTTP/SSE client cannot connect
- Ensure `xcode-mcp-proxy-server` is running.
- Confirm the URL is correct (default: `http://localhost:8765/mcp`).
- If you changed the listen address/port, check the discovery file: `~/Library/Caches/XcodeMCPProxy/endpoint.json`.
- Confirm `pid` is alive and `updatedAt` is recent; stale data should be ignored.

## `Address already in use` / `errno: 48`
Another process is already listening on the same port (default: `8765`).

- Stop the existing proxy server and retry:
  - `pkill -x xcode-mcp-proxy-server`
- Or rerun with `--force-restart` to terminate an existing `xcode-mcp-proxy-server` automatically:
  - `xcode-mcp-proxy-server --force-restart`

## STDIO adapter cannot connect
Ensure the proxy server is running and you are launching the adapter with `xcode-mcp-proxy`.
If you changed the server URL, pass it explicitly:

- `xcode-mcp-proxy --url http://localhost:9000/mcp`

or set `XCODE_MCP_PROXY_ENDPOINT` to the server URL. The discovery file should exist at `~/Library/Caches/XcodeMCPProxy/endpoint.json`.

## Codex `tools/call` times out after 60 seconds
Increase `tool_timeout_sec` in `~/.codex/config.toml` (this is client-side and separate from the proxy `--request-timeout`).

```toml
[mcp_servers.xcode]
command = "xcode-mcp-proxy"
args = []
tool_timeout_sec = 300
```

If you configured Codex via `--url`, set `tool_timeout_sec` on the URL server entry instead:

```toml
[mcp_servers.xcode]
url = "http://localhost:8765/mcp"
tool_timeout_sec = 300
```

## Codex shows `Transport closed` (then hangs)
If you see an error like:

- `tools/call failed: Transport closed`

it usually means the MCP server process (`xcode-mcp-proxy`) was terminated while Codex was waiting (often due to the default `tool_timeout_sec` being too short for slow Xcode operations).

- Set `tool_timeout_sec` (see above) to a value that covers the slowest Xcode tool calls you expect.
- Ensure the proxy server (`xcode-mcp-proxy-server`) is running and the discovery file is fresh: `~/Library/Caches/XcodeMCPProxy/endpoint.json`.
- If it keeps happening, restart the local processes:
  - `pkill -f xcode-mcp-proxy`
  - `pkill -f mcpbridge`

## Xcode dialog does not appear
Make sure `--lazy-init` is not set (when enabled, the dialog appears on the first request instead of at startup).

## `session not found`
Ensure the client is using the same session.
